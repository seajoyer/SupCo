* Dmitry Sidyuk's numerical methods homeworks

This file provides a brief descriptions of each homework. In case you use Nix, the template of each project if following:

#+begin_src shell
nix <command> github:seajoyer/SupCo .#<label>
#+end_src shell

The ~<command>~ may be:

- ~run~ to build & run a C++ program
- ~build~ to just build a C++ program (works weird yet)

And the ~<label>~ stands for a certain program of each project (see sections below).

For example, to run a C++ implementation of the [[#1-machine-units][Machine Units]] homework, you would do:
#+begin_src shell
nix run github:seajoyer/SupCo .#mch_uns-cpp
#+end_src shell

You can also use my development shell by executing:
#+begin_src shell
nix develop github:seajoyer/SupCo
#+end_src shell

** 1. [[Machine_units/README.org][Machine Units]]

Provides C++ and Python programs to determine machine epsilon, the maximum (giant), and minimum (dwarf) possible values of a floating-point number of different precisions.

Available labels:
- ~mch_uns-cpp~ for a C++ program
- ~mch_uns-py~ for a Python program

** 2. Coming soon...
