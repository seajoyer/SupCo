* Homework on floating point numbers

The repo provides C++ and Python programs to determine machine epsilon, the maximum (giant), and minimum (dwarf) possible values of a floating-point number of different precisions:

- half-precision (16-bit)
- single-precision (32-bit)
- double-precision (64-bit)

** Building C++

*** For Nix users

For happy Nix users, to build and run the project, it's enough to execute:
#+begin_src shell
nix run github:seajoyer/Machine_units .#cpp
#+end_src shell
Change ~.#cpp~ to ~.#py~ to run the Python program.

You can also start an isolated shell with all the dependencies by simply running:
#+begin_src shell
nix develop github:seajoyer/Machine_units
#+end_src shell

*** Manually

**** Prerequisites

First, install dependencies, this is done differently in different systems:
- A C++20 compatible compiler ([[https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html][Clang]] in our case)
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/make/#download][Make build system]]
- [[https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/][Eigen library]]

**** Building

1. Clone the repository:
   #+begin_src shell
   git clone https://github.com/seajoyer/Machine_units
   cd Machine_units
   #+end_src shell

2. Set the ~EIGEN_PATH~ environment variable to point to your Eigen installation:
   On most Unix-like systems, Eigen installs to ~/usr/include/eigen3~ or ~/usr/local/include/eigen3~. You can set the variable like this:
   #+begin_src shell
   export EIGEN_PATH=/path/to/eigen3
   #+end_src shell

3. And once you are ready:
   ~make~ to build
   ~make run~ to build & run
   ~make clean~ to clean the ~build~ directory

** Running Python

*** For Nix users

#+begin_src shell
nix run github:seajoyer/Machine_units .#py
#+end_src shell

*** Manually

1. Clone the repo if haven't yet
   #+begin_src shell
   git clone https://github.com/seajoyer/Machine_units
   cd Machine_units
   #+end_src shell

2. Run ~py/main.py~.

   Make sure the ~main.py~ file is executable (~chmod u+x main.py~).
