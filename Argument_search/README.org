* Homework on function arguments

The project offers a C++ program that searches for the first occurrence of a specified number (both integers and floating-point) and specific strings within the command-line arguments. The search targets are provided via the command-line interface.

** Usage

#+begin_src shell
$ build/Argument_search -3 ez -.69 aboba 3.14 1.a 7 -.69 ez

Integral number: 1a
  wrong candidate, try again: 3.14
  wrong candidate, try again: -3
  position: 1

Floating point number: 1.a
  wrong candidate, try again: -.69
  position: 3

String: ez
  position: 2
#+end_src

** Building

*** With Nix

For happy Nix users, to build and run the project, it's enough to execute:
#+begin_src shell
nix run github:seajoyer/SupCo .#argument_search
#+end_src shell

You can also start an isolated development shell with all the dependencies by simply running:
#+begin_src shell
nix develop github:seajoyer/SupCo .#argument_search
#+end_src shell

*** Manually

**** Prerequisites

First, install dependencies, this is done differently in different systems:

- A C++20 compatible compiler ([[https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html][Clang]] in our case)
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/make/#download][Make]] build system

**** Building

1. Clone the repository:
   #+begin_src shell
   git clone https://github.com/seajoyer/SupCo
   cd SupCo/Argument_search
   #+end_src shell
2. And once you are ready:

   ~make~ to build

   ~make run~ to build & run

   ~make clean~ to clean the ~build~ directory

   ~make help~ to see a help message
